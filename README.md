 # 🍛 Odin-recipe

I have developed this simple static website as the part of project from [Odin foundation course](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes) using HTML and CSS from stratch. This website has a homepage that links 3 recipe sites. Each recipe page has a small description followed by ingredients and steps to make a delicious recipe. Take a look at my work [here](https://rohini-h.github.io/Odin-recipe/).
